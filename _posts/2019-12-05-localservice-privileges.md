I want to tell you the story of a service account which lost all its powers (a.k.a. privileges). Windows world is getting increasingly ruthless and when the system considers you are not worthy, this is what happens. Fortunately for our service account, all is not lost, there's still hope. In this merciless world, you can always turn to the old sages to find some comfort and support. Among them, the Task Scheduler might be willing to help and restore what was lost, provided that you ask kindly...


## Sorry. No Impersonation Privileges For You.

A few weeks ago, Phillip Langlois and Edward Torkington of NCC Group published an interesting write-up about a [privilege escalation vulnerability in the UPnP Device Host Service](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2019/november/cve-2019-1405-and-cve-2019-1322-elevation-to-system-via-the-upnp-device-host-service-and-the-update-orchestrator-service/). If you're interested in Windows Privilege Escalation bugs on Windows, you should definitely have a look at it. They explained how they were able to leverage a COM object exposed by this service to get arbitrary code execution in the context of `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`.

Usually, in this situation, you could then elevate your privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` thanks to the impersonation capabilities of this service account. However, in that case, it wasn't that simple as they outlined in their conclusion. 

> _On Windows 10, the UPnP Device Host service is configured to execute without impersonation privileges as the user `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` with a ServiceSidType set to `SERVICE_SID_TYPE_UNRESTRICTED`. [...] Unfortunately, this prevents elevation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` via well-known methods [...]._

If you check the properties of the service, you'll see that it's executed with the `-k LocalServiceAndNoImpersonation` option.

And if you check the token associated to the process, you'll see that it has only two privileges indeed.

Other services, such as Bluetooth Support for example, run with the `-k LocalService` option.

In this case, we can see that the privileges of the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` account are maintained.

__Note:__ as a reminder, it might be a bit confusing but the `Enabled`/`Disabled` status of a privilege doesn't matter. What matters is that it is present within the token. If so, you can enable/disable them at runtime whenever you want. 

All that being said, in the case of a service such as the UPNP Device Host Service, is there a way to get all these privileges back? The answer is "yes" (otherwise there would be no point in writing this article :grin:). What is more surprising though is that it is quite simple to achieve. 


## Reproducing the conditions of the exploit 

In order to reproduce the conditions of the UPnP Device Host Service vulnerability, I'll use NirSoft's [`RunFromProcess`](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_from_process.html) tool to open a bindshell as a subprocess of the service. This requires admin privileges of course. For the bindshell, I'll use [`powercat`](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat). As its name implies, it's a PowerShell implementation of `netcat` and it's definitely one to have in your toolbox if you're a pentester. 

`RunFromProcess` usage is pretty simple. The first argument is the name or the PID of the process you want to run your executable from. The second argument is the absolute path of the executable. Then you can append a list of arguments for your executable. 

```batch
RunFromProcess-x64.exe 3636 "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -ep Bypass -Command ". C:\TOOLS\powercat.ps1;powercat -l -p 7001 -ep"
```

Be careful, it won't tell you whether it succeeded or not so you should check your command twice before running it. Once it's done, we can use `powercat` in "client mode" to connect to the bindshell.

```powershell
. .\powercat.ps1
powercat -c 127.0.0.1 -p 7001
```

Nice! :thumbsup: We have a shell in the context of `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` and as you can see we have only two privileges. We can therefore start working from this prompt. 


## The Task Scheduler Has Got Your Back!

Any user can create its own scheduled tasks in Windows and `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` is no exception to this rule. By default, the account used to run a Task is the same as the Task's "author". The scheduled task creation process is done through a series of local (or remote) RPC calls but I won't go into detail about this. 

Let's see what happens when we create a task in the context of a `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This can be achieved in three simple steps using PowerShell.

First, we need to create an `Action` object for the task. That's where you specify the program/script to execute along with some optional arguments. Here, we want to open a bindshell on port 7002 so we will use the following command.

```powershell
$TaskAction = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell.exe" -Argument "-Exec Bypass -Command `". C:\TOOLS\powercat.ps1; powercat -l -p 7002 -ep`""
```

Then, you can "register" the task and start it manually.

```powershell
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $TaskAction -TaskName "SomeTask"
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "SomeTask"
```

Let's use `powercat` once again in client mode to connect to the new bindshell and...

```powershell
. .\powercat.ps1
powercat -c 127.0.0.1 -p 7002
```

...we have all our privileges back!!! :astonished:

__Wait a minute...__ Do we really have __ALL__ of them back?! :eyes:

According to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localservice-account), the local service account has the following privileges by default:

- `SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME` (disabled)
- `SE_AUDIT_NAME` (disabled)
- `SE_CHANGE_NOTIFY_NAME` (enabled)
- `SE_CREATE_GLOBAL_NAME` (enabled)
- `SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME` (enabled)
- `SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME` (disabled)
- `SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME` (disabled)
- `SE_UNDOCK_NAME` (disabled)
- Any privileges assigned to users and authenticated users

All of them are present, at the exception of `SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME`. What's going on?!


## Going The Extra Mile 

At this point, we have the `SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME` and `SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME` privileges. That's enough for impersonating any  user so we could consider it's "game over". However, the fact that `SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME` was missing was bugging me. 

Therefore, I spent more time browsing Microsoft documentation in the hope of finding an explanation and I found it. It turns out that there is a small chapter dedicated to [Task Security Hardening](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-security-hardening). At the very end of this chapter you can read the following.

> _If `RequiredPrivileges` is not present in the task definition, the default privileges of task principal account without the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` will be used for task process. If `ProcessTokenSidType` is not present in the task definition, "unrestricted" is used as the default._

In a single phrase, we have multiple answers. 

- A task process is created with the __default privileges of the task principal account__. 

- If `RequiredPrivileges` is not present, the default privilege set associated to the account is used __without `SeImpersonatePrivilege`__. 

This explains why we were able to get our privileges back - except `SeImpersonatePrivilege` - simply by creating a scheduled task. However, it leads to another question: what is this `RequiredPrivileges` thing and can we do somehing about it? 

If you take a look at the documentation of the `Register-ScheduledTask` PowerShell command, you'll see that it accepts a `Principal` as an optional argument. You can use this `Principal` to _run a task under the security context of a specified account_. 

This `Principal` can be created using the `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal` command, which accepts the following arguments.

```txt
New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal
   [[-Id] <String>]
   [[-RunLevel] <RunLevelEnum>]
   [[-ProcessTokenSidType] <ProcessTokenSidTypeEnum>]
   [[-RequiredPrivilege] <String[]>]
   [-UserId] <String>
   [[-LogonType] <LogonTypeEnum>]
   [-CimSession <CimSession[]>]
   [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>]
   [-AsJob]
   [<CommonParameters>]
```

Here is the `RequiredPrivilege` option that was mentioned in the Task Security Hardening article. This parameter ___specifies an array of user rights that Task Scheduler uses to run the tasks that are associated with the principal___.

__Note:__ you can find a complete list of Privilege constants [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants).

We have all the information we need. Let's do this!

First, we create a String array containing all the privileges we want. Then, we pass it as a parameter to the `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal` command to create the `Principal` object for our new scheduled task.

```powershell
# Create a list of privileges 
[System.String[]]$Privs = "SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege", "SeAuditPrivilege", "SeChangeNotifyPrivilege", "SeCreateGlobalPrivilege", "SeImpersonatePrivilege", "SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege", "SeShutdownPrivilege", "SeUndockPrivilege", "SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege", "SeTimeZonePrivilege"
# Create a Principal for the task 
$TaskPrincipal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "LOCALSERVICE" -LogonType ServiceAccount -RequiredPrivilege $Privs
```

Then, we can use the same commands as before and specify our `Principal` object using the appropriate parameter.

```powershell
# Create an action for the task 
$TaskAction = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell.exe" -Argument "-Exec Bypass -Command `". C:\TOOLS\powercat.ps1; powercat -l -p 7003 -ep`""
# Create the task
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $TaskAction -TaskName "SomeTask2" -Principal $TaskPrincipal
# Start the task
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "SomeTask2"
```

Nice! :sunglasses: At least, no error/exception is triggered. Let's see if it worked by trying to connect to the new bindshell.

![](/assets/posts/2019-12-05-localservice-privileges/09_localservice-fullprivs.png)

It worked! And we have the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` privilege back! \o/

As a conclusion, I just want to say that Windows is a very complex Operating System and Microsoft has made huge efforts to harden its security over the years while still maintaining compatibility with legacy stuff. And, this turns out to be a very difficult and thankless job, especially when this same legacy stuff is also what cripples new security models.
