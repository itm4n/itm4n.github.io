Whenever I need to debug a protected process, I usually disable the protection in the Kernel so that I can attach a User-mode debugger. This has always served me well until it sort of backfired.


## The problem with protected processes

The problem with protected processes, when it comes to debugging, is basically that they are... protected. Jokes aside, this means that, as you know, you cannot attach a user-mode debugger to them, even if you have admin, `SYSTEM`, `TrustedInstaller`, or unicorn privileges. Knowing that this protection only applies to Userland, there are different ways of approaching this problem though:

- use a Kernel debugger;
- use (or exploit) a driver to __disable the protection__ of the target process;
- use (or exploit) a driver to __set an arbitrary protection level__ on your user-mode debugger.

I'm not very keen on using a Kernel debugger as it requires a second machine. You can also opt for local Kernel debugging, but it's very limited as you cannot set breakpoints.

The second approach is the one I have been using so far thanks to [PPLKiller](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/PPLKiller). I use its `disablePPL` sub-command to disable the protection every time I need to debug a protected process for research purposes.

However, this technique can backfire on you if you are not careful enough. It can cause important changes in the process' behavior at the Kernel level that you will not see until you find out that ~~your new shiny exploit does not work in real conditions~~ this protection is not completely useless after all. It can also trigger _PatchGuard_ and cause a BSOD with the error `CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION`.

Therefore, setting an arbitrary protection level on your debugger for instance appears as a better approach overall because the impact on the target process is limited to the debugging itself. There are already some projects, such as [pplib](https://github.com/notscimmy/pplib), that do exactly that, but I wanted to take this opportunity to learn a few things, implement them in a custom tool, and document the process along the way.

## How does PPLKiller disable PPL protection?

First and foremost, I will be talking about [PPLKiller](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/PPLKiller) by [@aceb0nd](https://twitter.com/aceb0nd) here, not the older [PPLKiller](https://github.com/Mattiwatti/PPLKiller) by [Mattiwatti](https://github.com/Mattiwatti), which is fully implemented as a Kernel-mode driver.

As a quick introduction, [PPLKiller](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/PPLKiller) is a tool that was originally developed with the objective of __bypassing LSA Protection__ (see the original blog post [here](https://redcursor.com.au/bypassing-lsa-protection-aka-protected-process-light-without-mimikatz-on-windows-10/)). To do so, it leverages __a legitimate MSI driver__ that exposes two interesting routines, one for __reading from__ and the other for __writing to__ an arbitrary memory area. These "features" are used as read/write primitives to locate the target process object in the Kernel memory and disable its protection.

To use the tool, you would first have to install the MSI driver with the command `PPLKiller.exe /installDriver`. Then, you could use one of the following commands.

1. `PPLKiller.exe /disablePPL <LSASS_PID>`
2. `PPLKiller.exe /disableLSAProtection`

The option `/disableLSAProtection` does the same thing as `/disablePPL <LSASS_PID>`, except that it automatically retrieves the PID of the LSASS process. The target PID is then passed as a parameter, along with a custom structure (more about that later), to the function `disableProtectedProcesses(...)`.

```cpp
// Source: https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/PPLKiller/blob/master/main.cpp
int wmain(int argc, wchar_t* argv[]) {
    // ...
    if (wcscmp(argv[1] + 1, L"disablePPL") == 0 && argc == 3) {
        Offsets offsets = getVersionOffsets();
        auto PID = _wtoi(argv[2]);
        disableProtectedProcesses(PID, offsets);
    }
    else if (wcscmp(argv[1] + 1, L"disableLSAProtection") == 0) {
        Offsets offsets = getVersionOffsets();
        auto lsassPID = processPIDByName(L"lsass.exe");
        disableProtectedProcesses(lsassPID, offsets);
    }
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

Disabling the protection of a process, given its PID, would look something like this.

```console
C:\Temp>PPLKiller.exe /disablePPL 644
PPLKiller version 0.2 by @aceb0nd
[+] Windows Version 2009 Found
[*] Device object handle has been obtained
[*] Ntoskrnl base address: FFFFF80220600000
[*] PsInitialSystemProcess address: FFFFE38E99E85040
[*] Current process address: FFFFE38EA2E8B080
```

The function `disableProtectedProcesses()` first opens the device `\\.\RTCore64`, which is automatically created when the (64-bit) driver is loaded. It will use this handle to send commands to it through the [`DeviceIoControl`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol) API.

```cpp
void disableProtectedProcesses(DWORD targetPID, Offsets offsets) {
    // 1. Open the device \\.\RTCore64
    const auto Device = CreateFileW(LR"(\\.\RTCore64)", GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 0, nullptr, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, nullptr);
    // ...
}
```

Then, it invokes the internal function `getKernelBaseAddr()` to obtain the address of the Windows Kernel through the [`EnumDeviceDrivers`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumdevicedrivers) API. This API indeed returns _the load address for each device driver in the system_, the Windows kernel being the first entry.

```cpp
void disableProtectedProcesses(DWORD targetPID, Offsets offsets) {
    // ...
    // 2. Get the Windows Kernel base address
    const auto NtoskrnlBaseAddress = getKernelBaseAddr();
    Log("[*] Ntoskrnl base address: %p", NtoskrnlBaseAddress);
    // ...
}
```

Now, brace yourself, because the next step might puzzle you unless you already are an experimented Kernel (exploit) developer. It loads the Kernel image `ntoskrnl.exe` with `LoadLibraryW` and uses the API `GetProcAddress` to get the address of `PsInitialSystemProcess`, which is not even the name of a procedure. Confusing, right?

```cpp
void disableProtectedProcesses(DWORD targetPID, Offsets offsets) {
    // ...
    // 3. Determine the Kernel address of PsInitialSystemProcess
    HMODULE Ntoskrnl = LoadLibraryW(L"ntoskrnl.exe");
    const DWORD64 PsInitialSystemProcessOffset = reinterpret_cast<DWORD64>(GetProcAddress(Ntoskrnl, "PsInitialSystemProcess")) - reinterpret_cast<DWORD64>(Ntoskrnl);
    FreeLibrary(Ntoskrnl);
    const DWORD64 PsInitialSystemProcessAddress = ReadMemoryDWORD64(Device, NtoskrnlBaseAddress + PsInitialSystemProcessOffset);
    Log("[*] PsInitialSystemProcess address: %p", PsInitialSystemProcessAddress);
    // ...
}
```

OK, let's reflect on that for a moment. First, `LoadLibrary(Ex)(A/W)` can load _either a library module (a .dll file) or an executable module (an .exe file)_ ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya#parameters)). Since `ntoskrnl.exe` is a Portable Executable (PE), this operation is therefore completely valid. Then, `PsInitialSystemProcess` is a pointer to an `EPROCESS` structure. So it's not a function, but it is still an exported symbol, hence why its address can be retrieved with `GetProcAddress`.

By subtracting the __virtual base address__ of `ntoskrnl.exe` from the __virtual address__ of `PsInitialSystemProcess`, we obtain its __offset__. This offset can then be added to the __Kernel base address__ to obtain its actual address in the Kernel memory.

At this point, you might ask yourself why this `PsInitialSystemProcess` symbol is so important. The symbol [`PsInitialSystemProcess`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm64bitphysicaladdress) is a pointer to the `EPROCESS` structure representing the initial `System` process in the Kernel. In this structure, one can find a [`LIST_ENTRY`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntdef/ns-ntdef-list_entry) structure called `ActiveProcessLinks`, which is the "head" entry of a doubly linked list.

![System Informer - Initial System process](/assets/posts/2022-12-04-debugging-protected-processes/01_systeminformer-initial-system-process.png)

From there, it goes through the process list and uses the __read__ primitive to extract the PID of each `EPROCESS` entry, until it finds the target one.

```cpp
void disableProtectedProcesses(DWORD targetPID, Offsets offsets) {
    // ...
    // 4. Find the Kernel object representing the target process
    const DWORD64 TargetProcessId = static_cast<DWORD64>(targetPID);
    DWORD64 ProcessHead = PsInitialSystemProcessAddress + offsets.ActiveProcessLinksOffset;
    DWORD64 CurrentProcessAddress = ProcessHead;
    do {
        const DWORD64 ProcessAddress = CurrentProcessAddress - offsets.ActiveProcessLinksOffset;
        const auto UniqueProcessId = ReadMemoryDWORD64(Device, ProcessAddress + offsets.UniqueProcessIdOffset);
        if (UniqueProcessId == TargetProcessId) {
            break;
        }
        CurrentProcessAddress = ReadMemoryDWORD64(Device, ProcessAddress + offsets.ActiveProcessLinksOffset);
    } while (CurrentProcessAddress != ProcessHead);
    CurrentProcessAddress -= offsets.ActiveProcessLinksOffset;
    Log("[*] Current process address: %p", CurrentProcessAddress);
    // ...
}
```

Finally, once the base address of the `EPROCESS` structure is known, it __writes 4 null bytes__ at the offset of the `SignatureLevel` member, but why is that?

```cpp
void disableProtectedProcesses(DWORD targetPID, Offsets offsets) {
    // ...
    // 5. Set the protection to 0x00 (= no protection)
    WriteMemoryPrimitive(Device, 4, CurrentProcessAddress + offsets.SignatureLevelOffset, 0x00);
    // ...
}
```

The concept of "Protected Process" was introduced in Windows Vista. At the time, the protection level was stored as a single __bit__ (`ProtectedProcess` member). Since Windows 8.1, we have the concepts of __PP(L)__ and __signer types__, which required a change in the structure. Therefore, the protection level is now stored in the `Protection` member, which is a `PS_PROTECTION` structure.

The term "structure" is a big word though. It is actually a single __byte__, where the __first four bits__ (from left to right) represent the __signer type__, and the __last 3 bits__ the __protection type__ (none, PPL, or PP).

```cpp
typedef struct _PS_PROTECTION {
    union {
        UCHAR Level;
        struct {
            UCHAR Type   : 3;
            UCHAR Audit  : 1; // Reserved
            UCHAR Signer : 4;
        };
    };
} PS_PROTECTION, *PPS_PROTECTION;
```

So, writing 4 null bytes at the offset of `SignatureLevel` would set these 4 attributes to zero.

```cpp
typedef struct _EPROCESS {
    // ...
    UCHAR SignatureLevel;        // 1 Byte
    UCHAR SectionSignatureLevel; // 1 Byte
    PS_PROTECTION Protection;    // 1 Byte
    UCHAR HangCount;             // 1 Byte
    // ...
} EPROCESS;
```

In the article [Protected Processes Part 3: Windows PKI Internals (Signing Levels, Scenarios, Root Keys, EKUs & Runtime Signers)](https://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=146) by Alex Ionescu, you can read the following.

> _\[...\] Furthermore, unlike the Protection Level \[...\], which is a process-wide value most often used for determining who can do what to a process, the __Signature Level__ is in fact subdivided into both an __EXE signature level__ (the “SignatureLevel” field in `EPROCESS`) as well as a __DLL signature level__ (the “SectionSignatureLevel” field in the `EPROCESS` structure). While the former is used by Code Integrity to validate the signature level of the primary module binary, the latter is used to set the minimum level at which DLLs on disk must be signed with, in order to be allowed to load in the process._

Which can be summarized as follows.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Protection level | Who can open the process (in regard to its protection)? |
| Signature level | Is the main executable's signature OK? |
| Section signature level | Are the loaded DLLs properly signed? |

So, is it relevant to override these 3 values? The answer is "it depends". It depends on whether you just want to open a PP(L) or inject an unsigned DLL into it. Here, we might just get away with overwriting the __Protection level__ byte as we just want to attach a debugger.

Ok, so the overall idea seems pretty clear, except for one thing. How does the tool determine the offsets of the different `EPROCESS` structure members? The short answer is: "it does not". Like many other tools, it has a set of hardcoded values, and it retrieves the OS version at runtime to determine which ones to use.

## Determine offsets at runtime

Using hardcoded offsets would be just fine in my case, as my intent is to develop a tool that allows me to debug protected processes for research purposes in a controlled environment. I'm not writing an offensive tool that needs to be super reliable, especially when dealing with the Kernel.

Though, I don't really like this idea. So, I wondered how difficult it would be to find these offsets dynamically at runtime. Again, I'm relatively new to these Kernel concepts so there is most certainly a better way of doing this, and I'm probably reinventing the wheel here.

For our needs, we need to determine the offset of 3 members in the `EPROCESS` structure: `UniqueProcessId`, `Protection`, and `ActiveProcessLinks`. So, let's see how we can approach this problem.

### The `UniqueProcessId` member

There is a routine in the NT Kernel called `PsGetProcessId` that does exactly what its name says. It returns the `UniqueProcessId` of the `EPROCESS` structure referenced by the `Process` parameter.

```cpp
HANDLE PsGetProcessId(PEPROCESS Process) {
    return Process->UniqueProcessId;
}
```

In x86_64 assembly, this looks like this.

```nasm
mov  rax,qword ptr [rcx + 0x440] ; 48 8b 81 40 04 00 00
ret                              ; c3
```

Therefore, we can just load the `ntoskrnl.exe` image, call `GetProcAddress` to get the address of `PsGetProcessId`, and simply extract the offset (`0x440` here) from the byte code.

### The `Protection` member

Similarly to `PsGetProcessId`, there are two (undocumented) routines, `PsIsProtectedProcess` and `PsIsProtectedProcessLight` that inspect the value of the `Protection` member to determine whether a given process is a PP(L).

```cpp
BOOL PsIsProtectedProcess(PEPROCESS Process) {
    // Returns TRUE if the protection type is either PP or PPL
    return Process->Protection.Type != PsProtectedTypeNone;
}

BOOL PsIsProtectedProcessLight(PEPROCESS Process) {
    // Returns TRUE only if the protection type is PPL
    return Process->Protection.Type == PsProtectedTypeProtectedLight;
}
```

Again, we can extract the offset of the `Protection` member from the byte code using the same method.

```nasm
; PsIsProtectedProcess
test  byte ptr [rcx + 0x87a],0x7 ; f6 81 7a 08 00 00 07
; PsIsProtectedProcessLight
mov   dl,byte ptr [rcx + 0x87a]  ; 8a 91 7a 08 00 00
```

### The `ActiveProcessLinks` member

As for `ActiveProcessLinks`, it might be a bit more complicated. There is probably no obvious routine that just queries this structure member without doing more complex stuff with it.

However, if we take a closer look at the `EPROCESS` structure, we can see the following.

```cpp
typedef struct _EPROCESS {
    // ...
    HANDLE UniqueProcessId;
    LIST_ENTRY ActiveProcessLinks;
    // ...
} EPROCESS;
```

At least, from Windows XP to Windows 10/11, `ActiveProcessLinks` is located right after  `UniqueProcessId`. And, we already have a way of determining the offset of  `UniqueProcessId`. If we just make the reasonable assumption that this won't change in the near future, we can simply add `sizeof(HANDLE)`, _i.e._ `8` (64-bit) or `4` (32-bit), to the offset of  `UniqueProcessId`, and we should be fine.

## Time for testing

I implemented this method in a tool: [PPLcontrol](https://github.com/itm4n/PPLcontrol). It offers basic functionality, such as listing currently running protected processes, getting the protection level of a specific process, or setting an arbitrary protection level.

Let's first enumerate all the protected processes with the `list` command.

```console
C:\Temp>PPLcontrol.exe list

    PID | Level   | Signer
 -------+---------+----------------
      4 | PP  (2) | WinSystem (7)
    108 | PP  (2) | WinSystem (7)
    392 | PPL (1) | WinTcb (6)
    520 | PPL (1) | WinTcb (6)
    600 | PPL (1) | WinTcb (6)
    608 | PPL (1) | WinTcb (6)
    756 | PPL (1) | WinTcb (6)
   2092 | PP  (2) | WinSystem (7)
   3680 | PPL (1) | Antimalware (3)
   5840 | PPL (1) | Antimalware (3)
   7264 | PPL (1) | Windows (5)
   9508 | PP  (2) | WinTcb (6)
   1744 | PPL (1) | Windows (5)

[+] Enumerated 13 protected processes.
```

For instance, we can see that the process with PID `1744` is a PPL with the Signer type `Windows`. Normally, if we try to attach a user-mode debugger to this process, we would get the following error.

![Attaching to a protected process results in an "Access denied".](/assets/posts/2022-12-04-debugging-protected-processes/02_windbg-attach-ppl-ko.png)

So now, let's apply the protection PPL / `WinTcb` to our `WinDbg.exe` process. As a side note, I chose this Signer type because it is greater than the Signer type `Windows`, but I could also have set the same type (but not a lower value though).

```console
C:\Temp>tasklist | findstr /i windbg
windbg.exe                   10592 Console                    1     32,748 K

C:\Temp>PPLcontrol.exe protect 10592 PPL WinTcb
[+] The Protection PPL-WinTcb was set on the process with PID 10592, previous protection was: None-None.

C:\Temp>PPLcontrol.exe get 10592
[+] Process with PID 10592 is a PPL with the Signer type WinTcb (6).
```

And let's try to attach WinDbg to the process again.

![Attaching to a protected process from a protected debugger works.](/assets/posts/2022-12-04-debugging-protected-processes/03_windbg-attach-ppl-ok.png)

Here we go! Without any modification to the target process, we are now able to attach a user-mode debugger to it.

## Conclusion

Clearly, I'm late to the party. Disabling protected processes by abusing a Kernel driver has been a known technique for years now. Protecting a user-mode debugger to allow it to itself debug protected processes isn't new either. It was already briefly discussed earlier this year in the article [Debugging the undebuggable and finding a CVE in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://medium.com/falconforce/debugging-the-undebuggable-and-finding-a-cve-in-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-ce36f50bb31) for example.

However, I don't think there is a blog post that documents the underlying concepts in the way I did. So, if you learned a few things from it, that's good enough for me.
