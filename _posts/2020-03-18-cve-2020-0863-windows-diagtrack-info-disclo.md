Although this vulnerability doesn't directly result in a full elevation of privileges with code execution as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, it is still quite interesting because of the __exploitation "tricks"__ involved. __Diagnostic Tracking Service__ (a.k.a. _Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service_) is probably one of the most controversial Windows features, known for collecting user and system data. Therefore, the fact that I found an __Information Disclosure__ vulnerability in this service is somewhat ironic. The bug allowed a local user to read arbitrary files in the context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## DiagTrack RPC Interfaces 

This time, I won't talk about COM but _pure old school_ RPC so, let's check the interfaces exposed by __Diagtrack__ thanks to __RpcView__.

![](/assets/posts/2020-03-18-cve-2020-0863-windows-diagtrack-info-disclo/01_rpcview-interfaces.png)

We can see that it has quite a few interfaces but we will focus on the one with the ID `4c9dbf19-d39e-4bb9-90ee-8f7179b20283`. This one has __37 methods__. This makes for quite a large attack surface! :wink:

The vulnerability I found lied in the `UtcApi_DownloadLatestSettings` procedure... :smirk:


## The "UtcApi_DownloadLatestSettings" procedure

__RpcView__ can generate the __Interface Definition Language__ (IDL) file corresponding to the RPC interface. Once compiled, we get the following C function prototype for the `UtcApi_DownloadLatestSettings` procedure.

```cpp
long DownloadLatestSettings( 
    /* [in] */ handle_t IDL_handle,
    /* [in] */ long arg_1,
    /* [in] */ long arg_2
)
```

Unsurprisingly, the first parameter is the __RPC binding handle__. The two other parameters are yet unknown. 

__Note:__ if you're not familiar with the way RPC interfaces work, here is a __very short explanation__. While working with Remote Procedure Calls, the __first thing__ you want to do is __get a handle on the remote interface__ using its unique identifier (e.g. `4c9dbf19-d39e-4bb9-90ee-8f7179b20283` here). Only then, you can __use this handle to invoke procedures__. That's why you'll often find a `handle_t` parameter as the first argument of a procedure. Not all interfaces work like this but most of them do.

After getting a binding handle on the remote interface, I first tried to invoke this function with the following parameters. 

```cpp
RPC_BINDING_HANDLE g_hBinding;
/* ... initialization of the binding handle skipped ... */
HRESULT hRes;
hRes = DownloadLatestSettings(g_hBinding, 1, 1);
```

And, as usual, I analyzed the file operations running in the background with Process Monitor.

Although the service is running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, I noticed that it was trying to enumerate XML files located in the following folder, which is owned by the currently logged-on user. 

```txt
C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Tips\
```

The user `lab-user` is the one I use for my tests. It's a normal user with standard privileges and no admin rights. This operation originated from a call to `FindFirstFileW()` in `diagtrack.dll`. 

![](/assets/posts/2020-03-18-cve-2020-0863-windows-diagtrack-info-disclo/04_procmon-details-FindFirstFile.png)

The folder seems to be empty by default so I created a few XML files there.

I ran my test program again and observed the result. 

![](/assets/posts/2020-03-18-cve-2020-0863-windows-diagtrack-info-disclo/06_file-copy.png)

This time, the `QueryDirectory` operation succeeds and the service reads the content of `file1.xml`, which is the first XML file present in the directory and copies it into a new file in the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\SoftLandingStage\` folder (with the same name).

The same process applies to the two other files: `file2.xml`, `file3.xml`.

![](/assets/posts/2020-03-18-cve-2020-0863-windows-diagtrack-info-disclo/08_file-copy-file3.png)

Finally, all the XML files which were created in `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage` are deleted at the end of the process.

__Note__: I created a specific rule in Procmon to highlight `CreateFile` operations occurring in the context of a `DeleteFile` API call. 

The `CreateFile` operations originated from a call to `DeleteFileW()` in `diagtrack.dll`.

## The Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability

The files are __not moved__ with a call to `MoveFileW()` or __copied__ with a call to `CopyFileW()` and we __cannot control__ the destination folder so, a local attacker wouldn't be able to leverage this operation to move/copy an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location. Instead, each file is read and then the content is written to a new file in `C:\ProgramData\[...]\SoftLandingStage\`. In a way, it's a manual file copy operation.  

The one thing we can __fully control__ though is the __source folder__ because it's owned by the currently logged-on user. The second thing to consider is that __the destination folder is readable by `Everyone`__. It means that, by default, new files created in this folder are also readable by `Everyone` so this privileged file operation may still be abused.

For example, we could replace the `C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\[…]\Tips` folder with a mountpoint to an `Object Directory` and create pseudo symbolic links to point to any file we want on the file system. 

If a backup of the SAM file exists, we could create a symlink such as follows in order to get a copy of the file.

```txt
C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\[…]\Tips -> \RPC Control
\RPC\Control\file1.xml -> \??\C:\Windows\Repair\SAM
```

Theoretically, if the service tries to open `file1.xml`, it would be redirected to `C:\Windows\Repair\SAM`. So, it would read its content and copy it to `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage\file1.xml`, making it readable by any local user. Easy, right?! :sunglasses:

Well... Wait a minute. We have two problems here. :confused:

1. The `FindFirstFileW()` call on the `Tips` folder would fail because the target of the mountpoint isn't a "real" folder.  
2. The new `file1.xml` file which is created in `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage` is deleted at the end of the process.  

It turns out that __we can work around these two issues__ using an extra mountpoint, several _bait_ files and a combination of opportunistic locks (see the details in the next parts).


## Solving The "FindFirstFileW()" Problem

In order to exploit the behavior described in the previous part, we must find a way to reliably redirect the file read operation to any file we want. But, we __cannot__ use a pseudo symbolic link straight away because of the call to `FindFirstFileW()`. 

__Note:__ the Win32 `FindFirstFileW()` function starts by listing the files which match a given filter in a target directory but this doesn't make any sense for an Object Directory. To put it simple, you can `dir C:\Windows` but you cannot `dir "\RPC Control"`.

This first problem is quite simple to address though. Instead of creating a mountpoint to an Object Directory immediately, we can first create a mountpoint to an actual directory, containing some _bait_ files. 

First, we would have to create a temporary workspace directory such as follows:

```txt
C:\workspace
|__ file1.xml 
|__ file2.xml
```

Then, we can create the mountpoint:

```txt
C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\[…]\Tips -> C:\workspace
```

Doing so, `FindFirstFileW()` would succeed and return `file1.xml`. In addition, if we set an OpLock on this file we can __partially control the execution flow__ of the service because the remote procedure would be paused whenever it tries to access it.

When the OpLock is triggered, we can switch the mountpoint to an Object Directory. This is possible because the `QueryDirectory` operation already occurred and is done only once at the beginning of the `FindFirstFileW()` call. 

```txt
C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\[…]\Tips -> \RPC Control
\RPC Control\file2.xml -> \??\C:\users\lab-admin\desktop\secret.txt
```

__Note:__ at this point, we don't have to create a symbolic link for `file1.xml` because the service already has a handle on this file. 

Thus, when the service opens `C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\[…]\Tips\file2.xml`, it actually opens `secret.txt` and copies its content to `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage\file2.xml`.

__Conclusion:__ we can trick the service into reading a file we don't own but, this leads us to the __second problem__. At the end of the process, `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage\file2.xml` is deleted so __we wouldn't be able to read it__ anyway.


## Solving The Final File Delete Problem 

Since __the target file is deleted at the end of the process__, we must _win a race_ against the service and get a copy of the file before this happens. To do so we have __two options__. The first one would be ___bruteforce___. We could implement the strategy described in the previous part and then monitor the target directory `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage` in a loop in order to get a copy of the file as soon as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` has finished writing the new XML file. 

But, _bruteforce_ is always the option of last resort. Here, we have __a second option which is way more reliable__ but we have to rethink the strategy from the beginning. 

Instead of creating two files in our initial temporary workspace directory, we will create three files. 

```txt
C:\workspace
|__ file1.xml
|__ file2.xml  
|__ file3.xml
```

The next steps will be the same but, when the OpLock on `file1.xml` is triggered, we will perform two extra actions. 

We will first switch the mountpoint and create two pseudo symbolic links. We must make sure that the `file3.xml` link points to the actual `file3.xml` file. 

```txt
C:\Users\lab-user\AppData\Local\Packages\[…]\Tips -> \RPC Control
\RPC Control\file2.xml -> \??\C:\users\lab-admin\desktop\secret.txt
\RPC Control\file3.xml -> \??\C:\workspace\file3.xml
```

And, we set a new OpLock on `file3.xml` before releasing the first one. 

Thanks to this trick, will are able to influence the service as follows:

1. DiagTrack tries to read `file1.xml` and hits the first OpLock.  
2. At this point, we switch the mountpoint, create the two symlinks and set an OpLock on `file3.xml`.  
3. We release the first OpLock (`file1.xml`).  
4. DiagTrack copies `file1.xml` and `file2.xml` which points to `secret.txt`.  
5. DiagTrack tries to read `file3.xml` and hits the second OpLock.  
6. __This is the crucial part.__ At this point, __the remote procedure is _paused___ so we can get a copy of `C:\ProgramData\[…]\SoftLandingStage\file2.xml`, which is itself a copy of `secret.txt`.  
7. We release the second OpLock (`file3.xml`).  
8. The remote procedure terminates and the three XML files are deleted.  

__Note:__ this trick works because the process performed by DiagTrack is done sequentially. Each file is copied one after each other and all newly created files are deleted at the very end. 

This results in a reliable exploit which allows a normal user to get a copy of any file readable as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Here is a screenshot showing the PoC I developped.
